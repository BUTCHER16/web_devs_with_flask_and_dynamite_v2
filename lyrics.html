            I didn't ask for a free ride
            I only asked you to show me a real good time
            I never asked for the rainfall
            At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
            
            It's coming down on me
            Water like misery
            It's coming down on me
            I'm ready, rain on me
            
            I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
            Rain on me, rain, rain
            Rain on me, rain, rain
            I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
            Rain on me, rain, rain
            Rain on me
            
            Rain on me
            Mmh, oh yeah, baby
            Rain on me
            
            Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
            Oh, but at least we try, mmh
            Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
            So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah
            
            I can feel it on my skin (It's coming down on me)
            Teardrops on my face (Water like misery)
            Let it wash away my sins (It's coming down on me)
            Let it wash away, yeah
            
            I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
            Rain on me, rain, rain
            Rain on me, rain, rain
            I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
            Rain on me, rain, rain
            Rain (Rain) on (On) me
            
            Rain on me
            Rain on me
            Oh yeah, yeah
            Rain on me, ooh yeah
            Rain on me
            Rain on me, ooh
            
            Hands up to the sky
            I'll be your galaxy
            I'm about to fly
            Rain on me, tsunami
            
            Hands up to the sky
            I'll be your galaxy
            I'm about to fly
            Rain on me (Rain on me)
            
            I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive (Rain on me)
            Rain on me, rain, rain
            Rain on me, rain, rain (Rain on me)
            
            I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive (At least I'm alive)
            Rain on me, rain, rain (Rain on me)
            Rain on me (Rain on me)
            
            I hear the thunder coming down
            Won't you rain on me?
            Eh, eh, yeah (Rain on, woo)
            I hear the thunder coming down
            Won't you rain on me?
            Eh, eh, yeah
            
            Rain on me
